## Model Description

The `elasfar-AI` model is a fine-tuned language model based on Hugging Face Transformers. It is designed to:
- Answer questions related to **Ibrahim Al-Asfar's** personal portfolio.
- Provide insights about projects (e.g., **Mark AI**), skills, and professional experience.
- Act as an AI-powered assistant on a personal website.

## Intended Use

- **Primary Use Case**: Interactive Q&A on the portfolio site.
- **Audience**: Potential employers, collaborators, or visitors.
- **Tasks**: Question answering and text generation.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies: `pip install transformers datasets torch huggingface_hub`
2. Train the model: `python train.py`
3. Deploy the backend: `node server.js`

## Training Data

The model is fine-tuned on a custom dataset `training_data.csv` containing question-answer pairs related to:
- Portfolio content
- Projects
- Skills and professional experience

The dataset is handcrafted to ensure relevant and precise answers.

## How to Use (via Hugging Face API)

```python
from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient

client = InferenceClient(token="YOUR_HF_TOKEN")
response = client.text_generation("How the United States was discovered ?", model="ibrahimlasfar/elasfar-AI") 
print(response)
